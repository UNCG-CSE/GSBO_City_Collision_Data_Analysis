Initial literature review indicated that intersections, speed limits and infrastructure are major areas that related to collisions
which can be controlled by authorities. While complex and non-signalized intersections seem to increase the chance of collisions,
speed limit increase has also increased total fatal collision rate.

Jorge-Made a report, current still investigating the data, still unclear
      How to do this in the way its expected. Doing this stuff in an
      impromptu way would have been easier and made more sense
